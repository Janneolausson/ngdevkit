# Compiling ngdevkit on the Windows platform

Compiling the devkit for Windows 10 is supported via [WSL][wsl]:

   * The devkit generates Linux binaries that can be used from your
     Linux environment or called like a regular Windows command via
     WSL's [interoperability wrapper][interop].

   * The GnGeo emulator is a native Windows GUI application. You
     can call it from both Linux and Windows and don't need a
     X server to run it.

You need to run a couple of manual steps before being able to compile
the devkit. This documentation explains how to compile ngdevkit with
Ubuntu on Windows.

## Pre-requisite

### Make sure you have an available WSL environment

Follow the
[WSL install documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
to enable the WSL subsystem on your Windows host.

Then go on the Windows store and choose a Linux distribution to
install on your Windows 10 host. This documentation uses Ubuntu 18.04,
but any other `apt`-based distribution should work the same.

## Building the devkit

### Configure the package repositories

Edit `/etc/apt/sources.list` to make the source packages from `main`
and `universe` repositories are available to apt. They are used to
resolve the packages that need to be installed to build gcc and
sdcc. Those two lines should be uncommented in
`/etc/apt/sources.list`:

    deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic main restricted
    deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic universe

### Install the dependencies

Install the packages required to build the devkit's compilers and
tools:

    # Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) needs that ppa for PyGame in python3
    add-apt-repository ppa:thopiekar/pygame
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install gcc curl zip unzip imagemagick
    GCC_VERSION_PKG=$(apt-cache depends gcc | awk '/Depends.*gcc/ {print $2}')
    sudo apt-get build-dep $GCC_VERSION_PKG
    sudo apt-get build-dep --arch-only sdcc
    sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
    sudo apt-get install python3-pygame
    sudo apt-get install automake
    sudo apt-get install autoconf-archive

Then install the mingw cross-compiler to build a native GnGeo binary,
and install GnGeo's DLL dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install mingw-w64
    sudo apt-get install libz-mingw-w64-dev

### Download SDL2 runtime and development files

You need to download the SDL2 development files (header, library,
pkgconfig) and the redistributable SDL2 runtime binary
(`SDL2.dll`) from the [SDL2 website](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php).
For example:

    cd $HOME
    curl -LO https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-devel-2.0.8-mingw.tar.gz
    curl -LO https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.0.8-win32-x64.zip

Extract the SDL dll somewhere and remember the location of that file
for later:

    cd $HOME
    unzip SDL2-2.0.8-win32-x64.zip
    # this yields a file $HOME/SDL2.dll

Extract the development files and install the mingw-specifc files
into system's default location:

    tar xf SDL2-devel-2.0.8-mingw.tar.gz
    sudo cp -af SDL2-2.0.8/i686-w64-mingw32 SDL2-2.0.8/x86_64-w64-mingw32 /usr/local

Note: even if Ubuntu's mingw package installs in `/usr`, SDL2 expects
mingw to be located in `/usr/local`; so extract into that destination
path, and let GnGeo autodetect it automatically during compilation.

### Download GLEW runtime and development files

As an optional requirement, if you want to enable the GLSL blitter in
GnGeo (which allows you to use libretro's pixel shaders for
rendering), you need to download GLEW's headers and pre-compiled
binaries from the [GLEW website](http://glew.sourceforge.net/). For
example:

    cd $HOME
    curl -LO https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/glew/glew/2.1.0/glew-2.1.0-win32.zip

Then extract the GLEW files somewhere and remember that path for
later, including the name of the extracted directory:

    cd $HOME
    unzip glew-2.1.0-win32.zip
    # this yields a directory $HOME/glew-2.1.0

Note that the minimal OpenGL requirement for the GLSL backend is
version 3.2 or above. Version 3.1 is not enough, so hardware with
an old integrated chipset probably won't work.


### Building the toolchain

Unlike other platforms, a native Windows 10 GnGeo requires all
its files to be located under a common directory. You need to
configure ngdevkit to install GnGeo into a custom directory.
For example:

    GNGEO_DIR=/mnt/c/Users/ngdevkit/Desktop/gngeo

Note: it's a good idea to choose a directory under `/mnt/c` if you
want to run GnGeo easily from the Windows explorer.

At this point, if you downloaded all the dependencies in the home
directory as describe in the example above, you can build the
toolkit with:

    eval $(make shellinit)
    cd examples
    ./configure --prefix=$PWD/local --enable-mingw --with-sdl2=$HOME/SDL2.dll --with-glew=$HOME/glew-2.1.0 GNGEO_INSTALL_PATH=${GNGEO_DIR}
    make
    make install

The `install` target will copy all the Windows 10 dependencies in
the GnGeo directory: the `SDL2.dll`, a mingw-compiled `zlib.dll`,
and the optional GLEW library if you enabled the GLSL blitter
backend.

And voil√†! You now have a devkit and a Windows-10-native GnGeo.
You can now build the examples as explained in [the main README](README.md) file.
