# ngdevkit, open source development for Neo-Geo

ngdevkit is a C/C++ software development kit for the Neo-Geo
AES or MVS hardware. It includes:

   * A toolchain for cross compiling to m68k, based on GCC
     5.5 and newlib for the C standard library.

   * C headers for accessing the hardware. The headers follow the
     naming convention found at the [NeoGeo Development Wiki][ngdev].

   * Helpers for declaring ROM information (name, DIP, interrupt
     handlers...)

   * A C and ASM cross-compiler for the z80 (SDCC 3.7), for developping
     your music and sound driver.

   * An open source replacement BIOS for testing your ROMs
     under you favorite emulator.

   * Tools for managing graphics for fix and sprite ROM.

   * Support for source-level debugging with GDB!

   * A modified version of the emulator [GnGeo][gngeo], with support
     for libretro's GLSL shaders and remote debugging!

   * A simple scanline pixel shader for a nice retro look!



## How to compile the devkit

### Pre-requisite

You need to install various dependencies to build gcc, sdcc and
ImageMagick for all the graphics trickery. You also need SDL 2.0
for the emulator and its source-level debugging support.
On a Debian-derived distro, this can be done with:

    apt-get install gcc curl imagemagick
    GCC_VERSION_PKG=$(apt-cache depends gcc | awk '/Depends.*gcc/ {print $2}')
    apt-get build-dep $GCC_VERSION_PKG
    apt-get build-dep --arch-only sdcc
    apt-get install libsdl2-dev
    apt-get install python-pygame

If running OS X, you will need XCode and brew:

    brew install imagemagick
    brew deps gcc | xargs brew install
    # gcc 5.5 currently only works with isl <= 0.18
    brew remove --force isl
    brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/87ddc3513e1d15f23d2bb270f63827a5daf1259c/Formula/isl.rb
    brew deps sdcc | xargs brew install
    brew install sdl
    # "easy_install pip" if you don't have pip yet, then
    pip install pygame

Compiling the devkit for Windows 10 is supported via [WSL][wsl],
detailed setup and build instructions are available in the
[the dedicated README](README-mingw.md).


### Building the toolchain

You may want to change `Makefile.config` to select a GNU mirror which
is close to you for maximum download speed. Then, build the entire
toolchain with:

    make

You can see how to use the toolchain by compiling demos in directory
`examples`. For instance:

    cd examples/01-helloworld
    make
    make nullbios

This will compile the example and copy the replacement BIOS into
directory `rom`. You can now run it with you favorite emulator.

## Using the devkit

Once compiled, the devkit is available in subdirectory `local`. In
order to use it from the terminal, you need to set up various
environment variables. This can be done automatically with:

    eval $(make shellinit)

You will then have access to all the binaries from the toolchain,
including the emulator and the debugger.

### Running the emulator

Testing your ROM is quite straightforward. For instance, these are all
the steps needed to compile and execute the example ROM:

    eval $(make shellinit)
    cd examples/01-helloworld
    make
    make nullbios
    make gngeo # or make gngeo-fullscreen for more fun

If you're running a recent macOS, [System Integrity Protection][sip]
will prevent running gngeo from make, so you'll need to run it from
your terminal:

    eval $(make -n gngeo)

### Debugging your programs

The devkit uses a modified version of GnGeo which supports remote
debugging via GDB. In order to use that feature on the example ROM,
you first need to start the emulator in debugger mode:

    eval $(make shellinit)
    cd examples/01-helloworld
    x86_64-gngeo -i rom puzzledp -D

With argument `-D`, the emulator waits for a connection from a GDB
client on port `2159` of `localhost`.

Then, run GDB with the original ELF file as a target instead of the
final ROM file:

    eval $(make shellinit)
    cd examples/01-helloworld
    m68k-neogeo-elf-gdb rom.elf

The ELF file contains all the necessary data for the debugger,
including functions, variables and source-level line information.

Once GDB is started, connect to the emulator to start the the debugging
session. For example:

    (gdb) target remote :2159
    Remote debugging using :2159
    0x00c04300 in ?? ()
    (gdb) b main.c:52
    Breakpoint 1 at 0x57a: file main.c, line 52.
    (gdb) c


## History

This work started a _long_ time ago (2002!) and was originally called
neogeodev on [sourceforge.net][sfnet]. Since then, a community has
emerged at [NeoGeo Development Wiki][ngdev], and it is a real treasure
trove for Neo-Geo development. Coincidentally, they are hosted at
[`neogeodev.org`][ngdev], so I decided to revive my original project on github
as `ngdevkit` :P

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to [Charles Doty][cdoty] for his `Chaos` demo, this is how I
learned about booting the console, and fiddling with sprites!

Thanks to Mathieu Peponas for [GnGeo][gngeo] and its effective
integrated debugger. Thanks to the contributors of the [mame][mame]
project for such a great emulator.

A big thank you goes to Furrtek, ElBarto, Razoola...and all the NeoGeo
Development Wiki at large. It is an amazing collection of information,
with tons of hardware details and links to other Neo-Geo homebrew
productions!
